Smart Fall Detection System

This project is a simple software solution for detecting accidental falls using simulated motion sensor data. It was developed for the Tech-a-Thon 4.0 - By ECE Society.

How It Works
The system uses a rule-based algorithm to identify potential falls. The logic is based on two key conditions:

Impact Detection and Post-Impact Stillness

How to Run the Project
Prerequisites
Python 3.x

The following Python libraries:

pandas
numpy

You can install these libraries by running the following command in your terminal:

pip install pandas numpy

Running the Script
Make sure you have the fall_detector.py file, train.csv and the test.csv file in the same folder.
Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to that folder.

Run the script using the command:

python fall_detector.py
